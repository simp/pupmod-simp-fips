* Fri May 05 2017 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 0.1.2-0
- Created a work-around for an undocumented issue where /boot is not
  on its own paritition but is added to the kernel parameters with
  fips=1. This situation ends up creating a kernel panic on the
  system until the boot= entry is removed from the kernel boot line.
- Added tests against GCE since that is the default image configuration
  on those systems.

* Thu Mar 23 2017 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 0.1.1-0
- The simp_options::fips catalyst did not disable fips; changed enable
  variable to default to simp_options::fips
- Moved check for OS family from params to init
- Added package remove for dracut-fips packages if fips is disabled
